# Canvas Calendar to Google Calendar
## Why Canvas Calendar to Google Calendar?
- We are lazy people!! We don't want to manually type in all schedules and due dates by hand!!
- Google Calendar is FREE!!!
## Features
### Remove all redundant canvas events:
- We don't like Office Hours bunch up in out Calendar!
- We don't like Discussion sessions and Lab sessions make everything else invisible to see!
- So we get rid of them all!!

### Optimized event names:
Note: Examples below are real courses.
- #### Before (Very unorganized):
  - AWP 4B - 000 - Analytical Writing B - Lastname [SP20] [AWP4B_SP20_000
 ]

  - MAE 3 - Lab Section A00\\, Firstname Lastname (Tue 00:00 am) [MAE3_SP20_
 A00]
- #### After (Organized):
  - AWP 4B Lecture

  - MAE 3 (L) Lab Section A00, Firstname` // (L) stands for Lab`
